# AndroidCamera2Sample

This is a sample Xamarin application using the Android Camera2 API to create a single view that can take pictures and record videos.

The sample can be read and understood on its own, but is intended as a companion to the blog post at https://hofmadresu.com/2018/09/11/android-camera2-trials-and-tribulations.html
